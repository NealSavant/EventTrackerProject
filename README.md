## Event Tracker Project

#### Weekend 12-14 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

A (REST) Representational State Transfer (API) Application Programming Interface. This project displays an understanding of CRUD operations on a full stack application using REST endpoints.

### REST API Endpoints

Get Event By Date - api/events{date}

Get Event By Name - api/events{name}

Create Event - api/events (JSON)

Delete Event - api/events/{id}

### Technologies Used

HTML

JavaScript

Java

MySql Database

Spring Data JPA

Spring MVC

Postman API checker

Git

### Lessons Learned

The JavaScript development for this application is lacking as I have been focusing mainly on another project using Spotify API which I am very excited to release soon :)
